Error: addIonsRand: Argument #1 is of type String must be of type: [unit]
    Here are some suggestions for correcting this error:
    Verify the type of an argument with the desc command.
    Check for alternate argument names with the list command.


    addIonsRand unit ion1 #ion1 [ion2 #ion2] [separation]

        UNIT      _unit_
        UNIT      _ion1_
        NUMBER    _#ion1_
        UNIT      _ion2_
        NUMBER    _#ion2_
        NUMBER    _separation_

Adds counterions in a shell around _unit_ by replacing random solvent
molecules. If _#ion1_ is 0, the _unit_ is neutralized (_ion1_ must be
opposite in charge to _unit_, and _ion2_ cannot be specified). Otherwise,
the specified numbers of _ion1_ [_ion2_] are added [in alternating order].
If _separation_ is specified, ions will be guaranteed to be more than that
distance apart in Angstroms.

Ions must be monoatomic. This procedure is much faster than addIons, as
it does not calculate charges. Solvent must be present. It must be possible
to position the requested number of ions with the given separation in the
solvent.
